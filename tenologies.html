                <h4>About Blockchain</h4>
                <p>
                  The history of blockchain started in 2008 when Satoshi
                  Nakamoto, whose identification is still anonymous to the wide
                  public until this day, published the white paper of Bitcoin .
                  Basically, blockchain can be seen as an online ledger that
                  records information in chunks or blocks or a list of records.
                  It is described as “a purely peer-to-peer version of
                  electronic cash ... based on cryptographic proof instead of
                  trust” . Blockchain uses five supplementary technologies to
                  form its unique properties
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <b>Secure</b>: Asymmetric cryptography and cryptographic
                      hash functions
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <h4>Asymmetric cryptography</h4>
                          <p>
                            The two different keys are used for encrypting and
                            decrypting data. While the public key is used for
                            encrypting the information, the other key called
                            private key is to decrypt the information as
                            demonstrated in the figure below.
                          </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <h4>Cryptographic hash functions</h4>
                          <p>
                            The Cryptographic hash functions takes information
                            input in an arbitrary size and generate the output
                            in a fixed-length size so called hash. This hash is
                            function is nearly one way only which means generate
                            the hash from data is easy but by knowing the hash,
                            there is no way to work backward and figure out what
                            the information is. Additionally, any changes to the
                            data will generate the different hash, indicating
                            its uniqueness like the fingerprint. Each block will
                            contain data, a hash, and the hash of previous block
                            as being shown in the Figure below
                          </p>

                      <b>Ledger</b>: Append-only databases
                      <p>
                        As an append-only databases, blockchain can be seen as a
                        ledger recording transactional information such as
                        sender, receiver, value, time, etc.

                      <b>Distributed</b>: Peer-to-peer networking
                      <p>
                        Peer-to-peer (P2P) network is an interaction without the
                        need of involving the centralized server (party).
                        Compared to a client-server, P2P is decentralized, less
                        vulnerable to single point of attack.
                      </p>

                      <b>Incentive compatible</b>: Game theory
                      <p>
                        As a result of proof-of-work, it creates a game called
                        mining where miners from all around the world compete to
                        solve a mathematical puzzle until they find a hash with
                        leading zero bits to satisfy the condition. Therefore,
                        this process requires a lot of computational energy
                        (hashing power), causing controversial debates about
                        bitcoin mining.

                      <b>Consistent</b>: Consensus algorithms
                      <p>
                        The transaction is validated by all users in the network
                        indicating its consensus. Therefore, a single person
                        will not be able to change the information without the
                        agreement of the whole network. When an individual joins
                        the network, one will receive the full copy of the
                        chain.

                Based on the five above mention properties, blockchain can solve
                many frauds and challenges in business field, especially finance
                and supply chain.

                    <h5>Application of Blockchain on Finance</h5>
                    <p>
                      Thanks to its consensus algorithms that each user on the
                      network keeps a copy of it, blockchain can solve the
                      double spending problem on finance . Secondly, in recent
                      financial system, any transaction requires trust because
                      there must be the third party to facilitate while in
                      blockchain there is no central authority needed
                      (decentralized network) making it higher integrity .
                      Therefore, blockchain in the next five or ten years could
                      change the landscape of financial system dramatically.
                      There is several evidence showing that few governmental
                      organizations around the world are taking a further step
                      toward cryptocurrency which is a result a blockchain
                      technology. For example, in Philippine, the Union Bank
                      uses blockchain technology, specifically Ethereum smart
                      contract, to build their payment financial system
                      connecting with rural areas because more than 65% of the
                      population are unbanked . The second governmental action
                      is observed in Australia since the Australian Commonwealth
                      Bank becomes the first bank to officially offer crypto
                      services to customers this November (2021) . Last but not
                      least, the most important event gaining great attention
                      among cryptocurrency investors and stakeholders, The
                      Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) offers an
                      encourage sign to cryptocurrency once approving the
                      exchange of Bitcoin Futures ETF in this October (2021) .
                      In short, these strong evidence indicate for the bright
                      future of blockchain development in Finance Industry.

                      Application of Blockchain on Supply chain management
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                      Due to its immutability and decentralization, blockchain
                      technology is able to solve the problem of traceability
                      and information feasibility in supply chain management
                      industry. As a supply chain sophisticatedly consists of
                      resources, human, activities, information exposing to the
                      three different movement flows from suppliers to
                      customers, it requires an extraordinary administration
                      during the whole shipment . Hence, a centralized supply
                      chain is more likely to have corruption, fraud, and
                      tampering which are addressed by using blockchain to
                      increase visibility and transparency. More importantly,
                      the issue of origin information is very essential in
                      agricultural and food supply chain, thus the application
                      of blockchain could protect consumers from counterfeit
                      product . In more detail, by providing precise and
                      confirmed origin of food, it evidently increases the
                      enterprises’ reputation, leading to higher profit and
                      return on investment .

              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Personal Impact</h4>
                <p>
                  From all the aforementioned indicators and evidence, it can be
                  concluded that blockchain will be disruptive to our life
                  remarkably, especially for people working in any industries
                  involving technological support. For our team, as the IT
                  professionals, the knowledge and experience with blockchain
                  will be helpful since there may be more business clients
                  seeking blockchain solution for their business information
                  management in the future. Secondly, the business analysts, we
                  must be alerted what are the latest movement in blockchain
                  technologies so that we can draw up business strategies
                  respectively. For example, when Ethereum smart contract was
                  introduced, it changes the way businesspeople do crowdfunding
                  when it poses a threat to the end of many large, centralized
                  platform such as Kick Starter. Therefore, no matter what our
                  future careers are, it will influence our life to some degree.

                <h4>About Raspberry Pi</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that
                    plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard
                    keyboard and mouse . It is a small device which can help
                    people explore wonderful features about computing and
                    learning about computer programming with Python. It can do
                    everything like a desktop laptop can do, from connecting the
                    internet, playing video, taking pictures to playing computer
                    games . Regarding its application, Raspberry Pi can be used
                    to teach children about how to code and introduce to them
                    about the foundation of computer science with the affordable
                    price when compared to the desktop laptop . Nowadays, a
                    Raspberry Pi costs under $100, and it can meet the basic
                    requirement for the computer. As you know, due to the
                    development of technology, programming or computer science
                    will become a compulsory subject for students in the future,
                    while buying a laptop for every student can take a huge of
                    money with about 1000$ per a laptop. However, with Raspberry
                    Pi we can provide every basic computer to student with the
                    much lower cost . Furthermore, Raspberry Pi utilises Scratch
                    contributing its user friendliness for beginner . With
                    Raspberry Pi, every child regardless of where they are from
                    can be exposed to technology and have many opportunities to
                    get a better life in the future.

                  <li>
                    Moreover, in the next three years, I believe that Raspberry
                    will become more and more popular not only in developed
                    countries like the US, England… but also in developing
                    countries like VietNam. Although Vietnam teaches information
                    technology for secondary and high school students, it still
                    has some weaknesses when compared to Raspberry Pi . Although
                    studying information technology in high school in Vietnam is
                    just studying some basic syntax about programming like
                    variable, function or for loop, these lessons are still
                    abstract for children, it is hard to understand and know how
                    to apply it in the life of a student. However, with
                    Raspberry, learners can use Scratch- the most beginner
                    friendly programming language- to develop their project and
                    they can create many practical projects like smart cameras
                    or a digital clock. These features of Raspberry Pi will make
                    it become more appealing to children and give them more
                    motivation on their programming journey. Secondly, I believe
                    that the price of Raspberry Pi will become more and more
                    affordable and the ram and rom of Raspberry Pi will improve
                    too much. If the price of Raspberry Pi will decrease to
                    under 10$, we can call for about 1.000.000 $ to buy 100.000
                    Raspberry Pi and will distribute these Raspberry Pi in the
                    schools in the countryside for the children. This will help
                    every child in our country have opportunities to be exposed
                    to computer science, this is one of the most crucial skills
                    to develop in this digital age when the industrial
                    revolution 4.0 is very close to their generalization .
                    Having an understanding about Raspberry Pi will give a solid
                    foundation about computer science for the children, and when
                    they become adults with the programming skills they can
                    create everything they want. There are many successful
                    people who prove that being exposed to programming when they
                    are children and having a solid understanding about computer
                    science can help them too much when they become older. For
                    example, Bill Gates studied programming when he was 12 years
                    old, and he developed this company when he was in
                    university, or Mark Zuckerberge taught his daughter about
                    programming when she was 5 years olds. Indeed, computer
                    science will become a compulsory subject as math of foreign
                    language in the future, and Raspberry Pi will play a crucial
                    role in helping people start their programming journey .

                <p>
                  As I wrote in the previous section, like the development of
                  every computing device such as laptop or tablet, the price of
                  this device will decrease while the size of the memory and the
                  speed of these devices will grow. Hence, in the near future,
                  the cost of Raspberry Pi will become under 10$, and its
                  resources like RAM and ROM can meet the basic requirement for
                  a computer which is enough for people to program every simple
                  function. Then, many countries will decide to choose Raspberry
                  Pi as the main device for them to teach their students about
                  programming instead of teaching programming on the computer.
                  This is because when applying Raspberry in their curriculum
                  they can save millions of dollars and also with Raspberry Pi,
                  users can create some small applications like digital clocks
                  or smart cameras . These applications encourages learners on
                  studying programming rather than studying abstract lessons
                  about algorithms as now in Vietnam. Furthermore, this device
                  increases users’ chances to approach the features of
                  programming, contributing to more programming-lovers which
                  ultimately results in a higher number of developers in the
                  workforce. Additionally, it will also enhance the competencies
                  of skilled software engineers. This is because, with the
                  growth in the number of labour in any area will create more
                  pressure and competitiveness for the people who have taken
                  part in this area. This will help more countries can keep pace
                  with the development of technology and industrial revolution
                  4.0

                  In my daily life, I think I will spend more time studying
                  Raspberry Pi. This is because, with Raspberry Pi, I can create
                  many cool applications which can improve my quality of life.
                  For example, I can create a digital clock which can help me
                  get up early. I can create a system which will announce to me
                  when any food will be expired today in my fridge. Mastering
                  Raspberry Pi can help me create a smart device to serve my
                  life as Tony Stark in Avengers. Exploring Raspberry Pi
                  programming will become my daily task, i will spend about 4 or
                  5 hours per week studying Raspberry Pi. This will become an
                  indispensable part in my programming journey. Raspberry will
                  not only affect my life but also affect my family opinion
                  about programming. For many people, programming is a daunting
                  and boring task, programming is the same as just communicating
                  with a computer and hard to create practical projects.
                  However, with useful projects which I have created in
                  Raspberry Pi, i think i can introduce to my family interesting
                  features of programming and have more and more people around

                  <li>
                    Robots are an influential element in today's manufacturing
                    industry . This is because the robot works simultaneously
                    with other equipment, peripheral equipment, and
                    manufacturing machines , where robot is integrated with the
                    system. In more detail, robots can skillfully perform many
                    arduous tasks and accurate operations without the general
                    safety and comfort necessities required by humans .

                    People now will easily determine which career path is best
                    for them based on their abilities, hobbies, and the sort of
                    work that they enjoy within the next three years . The usage
                    of online and offline software packages, for example, has
                    made tax preparation more accessible and convenient than
                    ever before. Non-resident aliens can save time by using tax
                    preparation software and online services. However, data
                    entry labor performed by employees in offices and even from
                    home is expected to become obsolete soon. It is conceivable
                    that robots will be trained to take over conventional data
                    entry jobs and responsibilities.

                    <h5>Brief history</h5>
                    <p>
                      The scope of what is called robotics is expanding in
                      tandem with technological advancement. In 2005, automotive
                      factories were the home of 90 percent of all robots who
                      were entrusted with the construction of autos at the time.
                      These robots are mostly composed of mechanical arms that
                      are charged with welding or screwing certain elements of
                      an automobile together. In today's world, we're witnessing
                      a more developed and extended definition of robotics that
                      encompasses the research, construction, and deployment of
                      bots that explore the Earth's harshest environments,
                      law-enforcement robots, and even robots that aid in
                      practically every aspect of healthcare .

                      There are two sorts of robots: independent robots and
                      dependent robots :

                        <i>Autonomous robots</i> are those that are capable of
                        operating independently and without the need for human
                        operator control. These normally require more intensive
                        programming, but they enable robots to take the place of
                        people in a variety of risky, mundane, or otherwise
                        impossible activities, ranging from bomb dissemination
                        and deep-sea navigation to industrial automation and
                        everything in between Independent robots be the greatest
                        disruptive force in society, destroying low-wage
                        occupations while opening up new opportunities for
                        economic growth and development.

                      <li>
                        The term <i>"dependent robot"</i> refers to a
                        non-autonomous robot that interacts with people to
                        augment and complement the activities of humans.
                        Advanced prostheses that are controlled by the human
                        mind are one sort of dependent robot that has been
                        created. This is a relatively new form of technology
                        that is continually being pushed into new uses.

                      Power is provided via an electric power supply, which is
                      utilized by the vast majority of robots. The two most
                      popular types of electric power supply for robots are
                      grounded electrical power plugs for stationary robots and
                      internal battery units for mobile robots, with the former
                      being more frequent.

                      Both the "brain" system of robots and the sensory system
                      are intricately intertwined and work in tandem to perform
                      their respective functions. Similarly, depending on the
                      job of the robot in question, robot "brain" systems may be
                      either very simple or very complex. If a sensor system
                      detects anything, a basic "brain" system would send a
                      signal to the robot's muscle system, directing it to come
                      to a complete halt and stop.

                        of the third agricultural revolution. This will not be
                        accomplished by displacing farmers, but by increasing
                        the farmer's added value while maximizing yield and

                <p>
                  When it comes to things like scheduling and organizing
                  correspondence, an assistant's skills are much more valuable
                  than when it comes to answering simple questions from
                  visitors. The time saved by having robots take over such
                  routine tasks allows workers to devote their attention to
                  concerns that have a tangible influence on the company's
                  bottom line, matters that need the use of greater brain
                  capacity and more ingenuity to resolve . The reality is that
                  robots are far more efficient than humans in many situations,
                  particularly when it comes to things like producing products.
                  Not only are robots capable of doing tasks with greater
                  precision, hence reducing the amount of time and resources
                  lost, but they are also capable of performing tasks quicker
                  (and for a longer time) than people. While this may have a
                  negative influence on the employment that people depend on, it
                  also has the benefit of lowering the price of products since
                  it lowers the cost of production. A larger number of
                  individuals can then afford such items, whether they be
                  automobiles, clothes, or computers as a result of the
                  increased availability of those goods. For example, a coffee
                  shop that employs robots to prepare coffee may (in principle)
                  cut the price of a latte since less labor is required to
                  operate the business in general. As an extension of the
                  previous point, this is a good place to start. Because robots
                  will be able to take over at least part of the tasks that
                  humans do daily, people will have more free time on their
                  hands in the future. As an alternative to thinking about
                  robots just in terms of the human, they could eventually
                  replace, it is useful to consider the advantages they will
                  offer.

                  Robots have a significant impact on our lives in a variety of
                  ways. Our civilization is witnessing a flurry of technological
                  transformations. What it is now will be quite different in
                  only a few decades. The fast rise of the artificial
                  intelligence and robotics industries has had a huge influence
                  on and transformed several facets of daily life, and this is
                  one key cause. As a human being, people need to take a break
                  after putting in long hours or accomplishing chores ahead of
                  schedule is necessary. Robots, on the other hand, may work at
                  any time of day or night. The installation of machine learning
                  algorithms and other types of robots is beneficial to business
                  owners and manufacturers largely to increase productivity.
                  They are thus keen to implement new technology, frequently at
                  the expense of their own workers' well-being. Job functions
                  such as education or natural science are examples of those
                  where robots will have the least influence since they are
                  engaged with people management, social connections, and
                  creative thinking. As a rule, these occupations are difficult
                  to automate. The primary purpose of new technologies is not to
                  completely replace people in their occupations, but rather to
                  make all processes safer and more efficient in general.
                  Instead of a clash, a mutually beneficial relationship between
                  automated robots and humans is being cultivated. The key
                  distinction is that for people, the task will shift from being
                  mostly technical to being more creative. They will build
                  business strategies, design and develop new ideas for
                  deploying smart machines in real life, control and evaluate
                  the outcomes, and conduct market research to determine their
                  effectiveness. As soon as a single robot can replace hundreds
                  of employees in restaurants, hotels, and other businesses, the
                  world will be a better place. Their service will be less
                  expensive since the owner will not be required to pay wages to
                  their employees. People are increasingly reliant on household
                  equipment to help them with their jobs, such as robot vacuum
                  cleaners and intelligent coffee makers. Overall, we are
                  experiencing some of the most exciting breakthroughs and
                  advancements in the world of technology, which are permeating
                  every sector and every social area at the moment.

                    <h5>Brief history</h5>
                    <p>
                      Virtual assistant is a new concept in the field of
                      technology and software, first known to the world in 1961
                      at the Seattle World's Fair, in the form of a device
                      called IBM Shoebox, with the ability to recognize voice.
                      By 1970, the US Department of Defense and its agency DARPA
                      had developed a "Harpy" tool that could recognize about
                      1000 words, equivalent to the vocabulary of a 3-year-old
                      child. It was not until the 1990s that virtual assistants
                      were officially researched and applied on personal
                      computers by leading manufacturers such as Microsoft, IBM,
                      Philips and Lernout & Hauspie. In particular, the launch
                      of the first smartphone IBM Simon in 1994 laid the
                      foundation for the intelligent virtual assistants we know
                      today. In 2011, the first modern digital assistant
                      installed on a smartphone was Siri, which was introduced
                      as a feature on the iPhone 4S. From 2017 to now, virtual
                      assistants have begun to attract the attention of users
                      thanks to practical applications, especially with strong
                      investment from large corporations such as Amazon with
                      Alexa, Google with Google Assistant or Apple with Siri.

                    <h5>How Virtual Assistant works</h5>
                    <p>
                      Voice assistant applications work on the Automatic Speech
                      Recognition (ASR) system. ASR systems record speech and
                      then break it down into phonemes, which are later
                      processed into text . A phoneme (not a word of a syllable)
                      is a basic unit of measurement for human speech
                      recognition. Phonemic recognition yields better results
                      than word decoding, since the end-user tends to analyze
                      the word as a standalone unit ignoring contextual
                      constraints. No matter what kind of speech recognition
                      software you might use, it is based on ASR. In regard to
                      how to create a virtual assistant software, the most
                      important thing to do is familiarize yourself with how ASR
                      works. In a nutshell, the process begins with the device
                      collecting the sound with the microphone. Recorded voice
                      waveforms are passed straight to audio analysis, which is
                      performed at three different levels :
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        The sound model, which represents what phonemes are
                        pronounced and what words these phonemes complete;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Pronunciation model, analyzing the pronunciation of
                        phonemes, having any stress or other peculiarities of
                        the vocal apparatus to capture the phonetic variation of
                        speech;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Language modeling, which aims to find contextual
                        probabilities depending on which phonemes are recorded.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    All data is processed by AI without human interaction,
                    reducing error rate by using machine learning algorithms .
                    The voice waveform data is then transmitted to the decoder,
                    where it is finally converted to text for further use such
                    as commands or dictation. Artificial intelligence gives
                    modern voice assistant apps the freedom not to rely on a
                    limited vocabulary, but to use cloud storage with millions
                    of alternative words and phrases. In other words, machine
                    learning makes applications listen to the entire speech, not
                    each individual word. That way, voice apps analyze context
                    and probabilities to determine what you're trying to say.

                      many of the products and actions that people use/perform
                      on a daily basis. The Amazon Alexa Everywhere strategy
                      begins a new trend of companies releasing service device
                      development kits for voice assistant app integration.

                      The Virtual Assistant continuously develop itself everyday
                      based on the data gathered. Soon, it will be more and more
                      familiar to the normal life of humans. People can really
                      communicate with Virtual Assistant as an usual
                      conversation with friends. This AI technology will be

                    <i>Threat of leaking information</i>: Researchers from the
                    international security company Check Point have just said
                    they have found a systemic vulnerability appearing in the
                    virtual assistant Alexa, paving the way. Allowing hackers to
                    access and steal voice history data and set up Alexa skills
                    without the user’s knowledge. This means that conversations
                    with Alexa involving users’ personal data can be hijacked
                    and used by hackers to break into their Amazon devices. A
                    typical approach a hacker might use is to create a
                    legitimate link to a website used to track Amazon shopping
                    information. After the user clicks the link, there is a
                    “shortcut” set up that allows the hacker to swap out the
                    usual skills the user has installed on their Alexa device
                    with malicious ones.

                    things without the owner’s knowledge by ultrasonic commands.
                    Like any waveform, sound covers a wide range of frequencies,
                    with some of which actually audible to humans. Any sound
                    wave below 20 Hz and above 20 kHz cannot be heard by our
                    ears, meaning it does not exist. Even so, phone mics and
                    smart speakers are perfectly capable of detecting sounds
                    beyond this range. That’s why they can be attacked by
                    ultrasonic commands, leaving the user completely at risk.

                  home, education, smartphone, hospitality, business… therefore
                  some specific jobs will be done without human workforce. This
                  may be the good but also the bad things for human. If people
                  know how to use Virtual Assistant appropriately, it will help
                  us increase the quality of daily life or our productivity at
                  works. Otherwise, Human will suffer a passive lifestyle and be
                  dominated by their own Assistant.

                <h4>Personal Impact</h4>
                <p>
                  I usually do not use Virtual Assistant for my daily routine or
                  works because of the lack of natural conversation from AI. But
                  I believe the situation will change the next few years. Life
                  is moving faster and busier, I cannot handle all the stuff
                  with high efficiency. The AI system can finish or remind me
                  many tasks, then I will focus on what are important and
                  urgent. And I hope the later version of Virtual Assistant can
                  support the old or people with disabilities with their
                  difficult conditions, the world is no longer too hard for
                  them, they can live and do whatever they want as lucky normal
                  people. Furthermore, in the future, when doing business or
                  doing research, using AI in forecasting modelling could be
                  adopted to support conducting my quantitative research. Thus,
                  having awareness, knowledge of machine learning and AI could
                  help me in my future.
