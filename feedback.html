						<h2 class="mb-3">#1. Dien Ma</h2>
						<p>
							Since our team has formed early in the sem-break, we have more
							time to prepare for our project. My team is the wonderful, which
							includes trustable and responsible people who always finish the
							workload before deadlines and helping the other team members If
							they have any blockers. This is the second semester of me, Thanh,
							and Tam so it’s is challenging for ours to meet the requirement
							for the good report in RMIT. However, my leader My is an excellent
							leader with the great management skills and she also help each
							member of team know how to write a report in RMIT with great
							citations. Thanh is a excellent time-management person, he also my
							teammate from the last semester, he also completes his workload
							before the deadline and very pleasant to help the other people.
							Tam is the creative person, he and My is the person who have
							contributed too much to our IT project with the excellent
							citations. My team also haves team meeting every week to assign
							task for each person and monitor the progress of this assignment.
							Hence, our project can finish before deadline without any pressure
							and stress on team members.
						</p>
						<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">#2. Thanh Nguyen</h2>
						<p>
							Since we began working on our project quite early, we were able to
							quickly establish our first concepts. Tam and My were familiar to
							me from the previous semester, but I did not have the opportunity
							to collaborate with them. Dien, on the other hand, has been a
							friend of mine since the previous semester. I consider myself
							fortunate to have met my three fellow partners for this semester.
							They are enthusiastic, hardworking, and well-versed in their
							field. I could pick up a lot from them, from the way they solve
							difficulties to the ideas they have for projects. When compared to
							my initiatives, their projects are eye-opening experiences. Their
							ideas are practical, beneficial, and innovative in terms of our
							future well-being.
						</p>
						<p>
							My is the most dedicated member of our group, in my opinion. She
							understands how to distribute assignments to each individual, and
							she completes all of her tasks on time. Tam and Dien, however,
							have quite different perspectives on technology; Tam’s is more
							insight-oriented, while Dien’s is more technical. They are both
							adept at dealing with the technological aspect. My, on the other
							hand, is skilled at writing and managing our collaborative
							process. I consider myself to be a supporting teammate who is
							there to assist them anytime they need it. Since our project ideas
							are similar to Tam’s and My’s first assignment project ideas, we
							decided to use them for our second and final projects. The
							majority of our projects include a variety of technology that I
							had never heard of before, requiring me to do extensive study to
							keep up with my teammate. I am glad of my team since we have not
							had any dispute while working on our project; otherwise, our
							procedure seems smooth sailing.
						</p>
						<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">#3. My Nguyen</h2>
						<p>
							Our group has been forming since the early starting week of the
							semester. Although most of us have yet met each other, we are
							fairly on the same page as sharing the same target, vision, and
							expectation of the group work outcome. In overall, I found a great
							sense of friends from the group project even though I do not know
							these teammates beforehand. From my perspective, neither technical
							skills nor hard skills makes us a perform well in the assignment
							but rather our attitudes. To me, all of the three teammates are
							opened to share and give honest comments toward a discussion, they
							actively contribute ideas to improve the project which I am
							enjoyed working with. Every weekly meeting was delightful yet
							productive and outcome-driven that we met all the targeted
							discussed points. Besides than that, all the three teammates met
							weekly deadline sufficiently. Since I am not a student majoring
							IT, I am not excellent at technical as much as these friends.
							However, I am really lucky to have their support and instruction
							during the project. In other words, I learn from my teammates a
							lot which is useful for my development.
						</p>
						<p>
							In regard to each person feedback, for Dien, creative and
							hard-working are the two traits I found the most in him which is
							believed to advocate him to achieve success in the future job.
							However, if I could give him an advice, it would be: “do not focus
							too heavy on your academic performance to forget other enjoyable
							parts of University’s life” because I used to be in such situation
							and now that I am about to graduate I find pretty regret of my
							time. For Thanh, he is little less engaged compared to the others
							but this is not a problem just because he is somewhat new to the
							university. Yet his performance in the group work proves that he
							is hard-working and competent for his career pathway. For Tam,
							with his previous experience in university life, he is doing his
							second degree at RMIT fairly well since he knows exactly his
							target for the journey. Tam actively contributes to group
							discussion which is good for the group improvement as well. In
							general, if I would have an overall advice to these friends as a
							person about to graduate, I would say: “do not waste your time on
							studying only, join more student activities so that you can
							explore more of your hidden abilities and talents”. If I had
							another chance to choose teammates for the course, I will
							definitely still go for these three responsible and hard-working
							teammates.
						</p>
						<h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">#4. Tam Kieu</h2>
						<p>
							My group formed in the early stage of the course. My teammates
							have worked together in previous courses, and I was the last
							teammate who joined this group. To be honest, there was some
							pressure for me due to their energy. But after quite a long
							working process, I know I was very lucky to be in this team. To
							me, they are talented in an unusual way.
						</p>
						<p>
							Thanh is very good at time-management, he would always be the
							first one who finished the tasks, and at every meeting, he would
							never be late. He is industrious and never stops if he cannot
							understand the problems. For me, he needs to believe more in
							himself because he has an intense potential to reach the big
							things. For Dien, he is the one who opens my mind and guild me
							very much. He has a very big dream, and why I heard about that, I
							realized that I must set my bigger goal which will always be the
							motivation for working hard. Dien can work 12 hours a day to
							follow his plan. He’s also such a kind person, always takes the
							hardest task without any complaints. I sincerely hope he can reach
							his dream, he is born for it. For My, she is a good leader with
							excellent leadership and communication skills, her efforts to make
							a perfect report also surprises me very much. She always makes
							things perfect with her talent. I believe that not only me but
							also every person will feel very lucky to have a chance to work
							with her. If I have another chance to working with these three
							talented teammates in the future courses, I won’t have any
							hesitation in joining them.
