            <p>
              This project aims to build a synthesized solution for COVID 19
              problem – an Automated COVID-free checking system for indoor
              environment which requires the sophisticated involvement of many
              types of technologies. The system will include application, AI
              cameras, sensors whose detailed designed algorithm will be
              explained in the later parts of this paper. The primary use of
              this system will be installed for indoor environment that helps us
              check whether the people are COVID-free without using currently
              available quick test kit costing more than two hundred VND each
              time. The system function will have real-time COVID check thus
              also saving our time. As being able to detect SARS-CoV-2 and its
              variants, the system helps to reduce the chance of asymptomatic
              spreading, safeguarding frontline workers and the community and
              avoiding outbreaks.

            <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">#2. Motivation</h2>
            <p>
              The SARS-CoV-2 virions (COVID-19 pandemic) – one of the most
              concerned human’s health crises starting from January 2020 – has
              hit the world harshly in almost every single field thus leading to
              a potential great global recession since people all around the
              world are directed to shut down a large number of community
              activities. Vietnam was of the top nations performing good
              COVID-19 prevention policies back in early 2021 that was
              acknowledged by both many renowned global news and peer-reviewed
              journals as a success story . Despite being a role model in COVID
              response strategies, Vietnam still struggles to cope with its
              fourth wave of the pandemic that many cities tightened the
              restriction policies and even closed from April 2021 until October
              2021 . Eventually, the nation with “0 COVID” policy turned to
              “living with COVID in a new normal” policy which again proves
              COVID is inevitable that human must deal with. However, until the
              drug treatment for COVID is approved, the advent of something
              could help human to recognized COVID is demanded. Evidently, the
              high mortality rate resulting in consecutive disruptions entails
              severe consequences across the globe . It is fact, Hospitality and
              tourism industry, for instant, is the most suffering sector since
              the strict strategies from Vietnamese government of border
              closures, travel restrictions, quarantine was applied early the
              pandemic started . Only in this sector, the economic loss hit
              US$5.9–7.7 billion in only three months , which is attributed to
              78.7% drop in international tourism .
            </p>
            <p>
              Yet, the current available approaches to prevent the COVIS spread
              is not strong enough to resume social activities safely due to
              several reasons. The quick test kit and PCR test, for example, are
              costly and un-reusable, and not real-time . Firstly, once a guest
              book the hotel staycation, the person is able to provide the
              evidence of ‘positive test’ (no infection) by the quick test kit
              and PCR test within 24 hours. Yet there is no guarantee that this
              result reflects his/ her true status when the person arrives at
              the hotel. There is still chance that the person is infected
              during the travel to hotel, indicating its inability of giving
              real-time result. Secondly, these tests can only be applicable
              less than 72 hours, meaning un-reusable after this duration.
              Thirdly, these tests are costly.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a consequently, the urgent need of a real-time and
              cost-advantage detecting COVID-19 system is obvious. Therefore,
              this project acts as a critical contribution to such an
              uncertainty and volatile situation of COVID that could help us to
              resume community activities, flattening the curve global
              recession.

            <ol>
              <li>
                <h5>Devices</h5>
                <p>
                  The whole system is made up of three primary technologies:
                  instant biosensor, AI camera, application (administrative
                  system)
                </p>

                  <li>
                    <h5>
                      Instant Biosensors (2 components: the personal tag &
                      reader)
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                      An advanced nanomaterial biosensor. This sensor can detect
                      antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2. The method of
                      identifying specific antibodies to viral antigens is one
                      of the two main methods to detect infectious diseases
                      today. Antibody testing can help doctors and researchers
                      verify whether a vaccine is working during treatment and
                      identify asymptomatic cases in a certain population.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In addition to testing capabilities, this basic sensor
                      also helps to accurately quantify the body’s immune
                      response to the new vaccine, allowing doctors to make
                      accurate diagnoses. Antibody detection is performed
                      through an electrochemical reaction in a hand-held
                      microfluidic device, after which results are quickly
                      displayed through a simple smartphone interface.
                      Scientists have used the latest advances in materials and
                      manufacturing, such as 3D printing of nanoparticles, to
                      build a device that can rapidly detect Covid-19 antibodies
                      . Aerosol injection 3D printing additive manufacturing
                      technology was used to ensure the efficiency and accuracy
                      of the test equipment. Small, inexpensive gold
                      micrometallic electrodes are printed at the nanoscale
                      using aerosol droplets, bonded together by thermal
                      sintering. This method creates a rough, irregular surface,
                      increases the surface area of the micropoles and
                      electrochemical reaction, the area where the antibodies
                      can bind to the antigens coated on the electrode from
                      there, helping to detect quickly and accurately the risk
                      of COVID-19 infection in the environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This idea of using sensor to detect COVID in real-time has
                      long been researched and attempted by many professors
                      coming from universities around the world. One of the
                      earliest and most successful projects is from RMIT
                      University . After this successful research, the trial
                      program was run in Melbourne. More detail, the sensor
                      tag’s size is as small as an air pod case which is
                      convenient for people to bring it everywhere all the time.
                      The personal tag will be synthesized with the Ministry of
                      Health (MOH) to also get the status of the individual’s
                      vaccination. Moreover, this personal sensor tag is also
                      equipped with Bluetooth connection to minimize physical
                      touch as much as possible and easier to share your health
                      status to a friend’s phone without swiping or touching.
                      The readers will be installed in the room doors. Before
                      entering, people must exhale to their personal sensor tag
                      then swiping their personal tag to the checkpoint readers.
                      The data from reader will be communicate to the cloud
                      system that people can monitor via application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The currently available technological advancement allows
                      us to have thermal camera fever detection but not yet the
                      COVID one. Therefore, developing this to a further level
                      by incorporating cough sound checking, we are able to have
                      an AI camera that could detect SARS-CoV-2 and its variants
                      as people walk by the camera. To achieve this product, a
                      high level of training AI is required so that it is
                      capable of recognizing COVID in forced cough. Since many
                      people are asymptomatic which is 25% of the infection
                      sample with 95% confidence interval according to a
                      systematic review and meta-analysis by Alene et al. this
                      is essential to make the system more practical and
                      reliable in real-life application. Regarding the practical
                      ability of sound cough detecting, there are many
                      successful researched projects and implementation
                      including the ones by RMIT University and by MIT
                      (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Additionally
                      starting from mid 2021, Vietnam started on this race of
                      COVID sound checking on forced cough according to
                      Saigoneer .

                        This plays an important role in succeeding in any project. This skill can create consistent communication between team members. “ A study analyzed the reasons for project failure in the UK’s finance sector and found that communication breakdown was the main cause of failure for 57% of the studied projects” . An exceptional manager can allocate efficient resources for these projects, these resources can be human or money. With excellent resource allocation, we can assign the suitable member to a suitable task, and using the technology which can match with our objective to make this project can delivery on time .

            <p>
                Once the initial trial of this project successes, a higher propose to implement piloting program in a small specific place will be the next step before it could be nationwide adopted. More specifically, RMIT University Vietnam Saigon South Campus could be an ideal environment to test the system as there are technological readiness to support the implementation. The demonstration is shown in Figure 21 that sensor readers will be installed in every entrance point, AI camera will be installed in every critical and high traffic point. Furthermore, inside a building, the senser readers will be installed in every room (Figure 22) so that we can make sure people’s status before granting access for them to the space. By doing this, we are creating a safe environment for every person in such space.

            <p>
                At the first stage, after successfully piloting at RMIT SGS campus, the collaboration with other organizations to further expand the pilot program could be attempted to test its effectiveness and practicability before introducing the system to the public. Therefore, it could be targeted to reach at least 3000 users from three organizations at the end of piloting. The more users, the higher trustworthiness our system is proved. If this project succeed, further action could be proposed to improve the users experiences as well as incorporating more detecting features. 
            </p>

                In the future, even when the COVID drug treatment is approved, this system is still strongly believed to be beneficial as it helps us to recognize the COVID person more effectively and efficiently. Hence, the action to be taken will be more meaningful to cope with this illness. Furthermore, besides the practical purpose recognizing COVID, the success of such system is supposed to pave the way for further research to the invention of more systems addressing infectious diseases, and any respiratory related diseases.
