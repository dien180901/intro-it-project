                    <ul>Hobbies
                        <li>Coding and Technology: Before I decide to study Information Technology at RMIT, I graduated from FTU and working at a technology company as a Sales manager assistance. While working at a technology environment, I find passion at coding and technical stuffs. I can’t stand talking with my company’s partner for 1 hour, but I can spend hours for study programming languages. After studying Python by myself, I decide to follow my passion and quit my job. </li>
                        <li>Running: At the beginning, I just run for losing weight. But for years, I realize running is the best way for me to train my patient and recover from stress.

                    <ul>Goals
                        <li>Career: Deciding to learn Information Technology, I aim to work at Silicon Valleys as a full-stack developer. After learning from my job, I want to run a tech-startup.   </li>
                        <li>Life: One of the reasons why I leave my job behind and study IT at RMIT is my income, I don’t see the chance of moving forward. I want to have a comfortable circumstance that I can support my family whenever they need, whatever they want. I believe IT career will help me reach my goal.  </li>
                    </ul>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <ul>RMIT is not my first university, I graduated from Foreign Trade University (FTU) before. But my path at FTU was not advantageous as I expected.  I choose my first university without considering my strengths and who I love to become in the future. Then I lost myself and graduated with the lowest grade. Poor university performance kicked me out of working in any big company. I started my first fulltime job as a sales manager assistance at a tech-startup. Usually, my boss asked me to support the test department due to lack of staff. Therefore, I had a chance to reach coding and technology, then I taught myself through coding tutorial on YouTube after every workday. When coding, I found my ego, I know it is hard to believe. I love solving math problems since I was in secondary school, coding brings back my feeling of the old days, the feelings of spend all the energy I have to solve a hard problem, rejoice the result. To say what event sparked me, it was a decision to work in this small tech company, where I had to do many tasks being very different to my major, I found my motivation for changing.   
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>I quit my job when I was 22, I believed I would never have another chance to build my career again, I had to choose the most compatible university for me. I looked back of all the university I used to want to go to before choosing FTU. RMIT came to my mind due to the international qualification and the program just takes 3 years or even less. My mother used to ask me to enroll in RMIT when I was 18, not until I was 22, I followed her advice.      
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>As a result of COVID-19's tremendous effect, I found myself departing from the norm once more when it came to coding. After my first semester at Langara, I returned to Vietnam and transferred to RMIT in order to be closer to my family and friends. As my third attempt, I chose Information Technology as my next step.     
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>Initially, I chose big data as my career, because I thought my knowledge of FTU would be useful. But after taking some programming courses at RMIT, I decided to be a full-stack developer. Since I aimed to go on that way, I expect to learn and practice projects for frontend and backend parts, and study deeply in Java, Python.     
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>

              </p>
            <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Ideal job</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <ul>Position: Full stack leader <a href="https://www.vietnamworks.com/java-full-stack-leader-1-1428119-jv/?source=searchResults&searchType=2&placement=1428120&sortBy=date">(Job link HERE)  </a>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>Although I always aim to be a Java full stack developer, but I believe some days I will be too old for coding in a continuously process. Therefore, my career path should move forward to be a leader of a team, at the position where I response for designing, supporting, managing people using my experiences. Moreover, I can realize that I will earn very much money without working hard as a fresher or junior or even senior.   
                        
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>This position requires the candidate to be professional and deeply understand many programming skills such as micro services, frontend, backend, relational database, big data techniques and tools, Git, SVN, AWS services… But it is not enough to be a leader. They require the candidate to have high communication skills, influent English, and Agile methodologies. Due to a huge collection of qualifications of that role, I think the requirement is right to find a candidate with more than 10 years' experience, when they have enough time for study and understand full stack stuffs. And at the age of 30 or more, they will know how to lead a team.  
                        
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <ul>Until now I do not have any qualification showing if I can meet any of the job requirements. However, I have acquired some of the skills below that may help me build a future plan for myself: .  
                        <li>Backend with Python, Java, NodeJS</li>
                        <li> Frontend with CSS, HTML, JavaScript</li>
                        <li>Working with relational schemas by MySQL, PostgreSQL</li>
                        <li> Leadership skill and Scrum experience due to graduating from FTU and 1 year working  in a tech-startup</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    
                    <ul>Acknowledging my current skills and the competitiveness of the job position, I have built up a plan for myself with several milestones to fulfill the expertise expectation listed in the job requirement. The plan includes some of the milestones below:     
                        <li>Self-training frontend frameworks in the last semester of first year</li>
                        <li> Aim to be an intern of Java from the second years of RMIT</li>
                        <li>Graduating from RMIT with High Distinction degree.</li>
                        <li>Being a Java fresher of at COSATECH</li>
                        <li> Keep learning to fulfilling the skill requirements through working.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
